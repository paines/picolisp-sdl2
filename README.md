# picolisp-sdl2
PicoLisp SDL2 Bindings


minimal SDL2 library for PicoLisp

what works: not much!
  - a short rudimentary example which shows the initialization and rendering of an buffer to a texture which is blitted to the     renderer 
  

To do:
  -Cleanup and give variables and namnes uppercase characters
  -Events!!!


Shoutouts to: All from freenode/#picolisp, especially Regenaxer for support and advice!
