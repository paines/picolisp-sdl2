# picolisp-sdl2
PicoLisp SDL2 Bindings


minimal SDL2 library for PicoLisp

what works: not much!
  - a short rudimentary example which shows the initialization and rendering of an buffer to a texture which is blitted to the     renderer 
  

To do:
  - Cleanup and give variables and names uppercase characters
   - Example: pixel loop should be changed to a lisp list and then converted to an array, maybe via some library function
   - Events, this is a though one, because it is all about structures


Shoutouts and thanks to: All from freenode/#picolisp, especially Regenaxer for support and advice!
